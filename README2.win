Tips for Documenting and Reporting:
1.	Organize Evidence: Keep any supporting evidence (screenshots, messages, documents) in clearly labeled folders or files. Refer to these in your incident log using a reference number or name. This allows you to provide details when requested without having to recount everything repeatedly.
2.	Focus on Facts: When documenting incidents, concentrate on the objective details: who was involved, what happened, where it occurred, and when.
3.	Seek Support: Look for organizations or services that provide support to individuals who have experienced similar situations. They can offer guidance and resources.
4.	Reporting to Authorities: When you meet with authorities, be prepared to share your summary and incident log. You can provide the detailed evidence if they request it.
Gathering and organizing this information is a significant step in seeking help. Focus on presenting the facts in a clear manner.
